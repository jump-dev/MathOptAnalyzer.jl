    Analyzer() <: MathOptAnalyzer.AbstractAnalyzer

The `Analyzer` type is used to perform feasibility analysis on a model.

## Example

```julia
julia> data = MathOptAnalyzer.analyze(
    MathOptAnalyzer.Feasibility.Analyzer(),
    model;
    primal_point::Union{Nothing, Dict} = nothing,
    dual_point::Union{Nothing, Dict} = nothing,
    primal_objective::Union{Nothing, Float64} = nothing,
    dual_objective::Union{Nothing, Float64} = nothing,
    atol::Float64 = 1e-6,
    skip_missing::Bool = false,
    dual_check = true,
);
```

The additional parameters:
- `primal_point`: The primal solution point to use for feasibility checking.
  If `nothing`, it will use the current primal solution from optimized model.
- `dual_point`: The dual solution point to use for feasibility checking.
  If `nothing` and the model can be dualized, it will use the current dual
  solution from the model.
- `primal_objective`: The primal objective value considered as the solver
  objective. If `nothing`, it will use the current primal objective value from
  the model (solver).
- `dual_objective`: The dual objective value considered as the solver
  objective. If `nothing`, it will use the current dual objective value from
  the model (solver).
- `atol`: The absolute tolerance for feasibility checking.
- `skip_missing`: If `true`, constraints with missing variables in the provided
  point will be ignored.
- `dual_check`: If `true`, it will perform dual feasibility checking. Disabling
  the dual check will also disable complementarity checking and dual objective
  checks.

The `DualConstrainedVariableViolation` issue is identified when a dual

that is not within the dual constraint's set.
During the dualization  process, each primal constraint is mapped to a dual
variable, this dual variable is tipically a constrained variable with the
dual set of the primal constraint. If the primal constraint is a an equality
type constraint, the dual variable is a free variable, hence, not constrained
(dual) variable.
This dual constraint corresponds to a primal (non-equality) constraint.
