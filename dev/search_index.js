Complementary slackness conditions are also checked (if applicable).\nInfeasibility Analysis: Given an unsolved of solved model, three steps are made to check for infeasibility:\nCheck bounds, integers and binaries consistency is also checked at this point.\nPropagate bounds in constraints individually, to check if each constraint is infeasible given the current variable bounds. This is only done if bounds are ok.\nRun an IIS (Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem / irreducible infeasible sets) resolver algorithm to find a minimal infeasible subset of constraints. This is only done if no issues are found in the previous two steps.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"MathOptAnalyzer.jl","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"MathOptAnalyzer.jl","title":"MathOptAnalyzer.jl","text":"You can install the package using the Julia package manager.
